                We want to make Uber the most diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace in the world. Recruiting has always been a driving force in many D&I initiatives and we have made significant progress, but there’s still a lot to do. That’s why last year we welcomed Eve Lewis as our first-ever Global Head of Inclusive Recruiting to work at the intersection of Diversity and Recruiting and seize the enormous opportunities to accelerate our journey.

                You’ve spent over 20 years driving diversity and inclusive marketing and Talent Acquisition programs at some major companies. Why did you join Uber?

            “Prior to coming to Uber, I was at a place that’s noted for having diversity as part of its DNA, and Uber was never even in my consideration as an employer of choice as a black female. I’d heard a lot about the journey Uber’s been on and didn’t understand the incredible things going on in the company. Once I started having conversations, I realized that external perceptions don’t reflect what the company is truly doing and driving in this space. Uber is a remarkable platform to drive change in D&I in a way that’s scalable, efficient, and makes a difference.”
